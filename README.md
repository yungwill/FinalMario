# Mario

Group project for CPSC 386. We were required to remake the entirty of the 1st level of Mario.
All programming was done with no previous experience in Python except what was learned in the CPSC 386 class.
Weeks Given to Complete Project: 4 weeks 

Bugs/Problems/Not Implemented:
  -Not all animations are implemented
  -Some delay when coming out of the secret level.
  -Interaction with certain blocks causes Mario to automatically move.
